When the user posts about their car issue then they are able to recieve feedback from other users that will comment on the post. The user is able to create a sign up with their email and log in to see what other users have posted. The user can also interact with the application by commenting on posts by other users. We also worked to incorporate a random password generator the user can use when they sign up.",
